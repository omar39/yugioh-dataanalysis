## Summary of findings
The main purpose of this exploration is to get to know the game with an abstract view of the game cards. We also explored the game and try to find relations and to answer some questions that arise in deeper analyses.
I found that the majority of the cards are the monster cards then spell and trap cards. So I needed to explore more in the monsters and found that a monster may have lose attack and defense points, their attack and defense points tends to increase with the increase of their level. Also, Dragon-Type monsters have the highest average attack and defense points among the monsters' game.

## Key Insights for the Presentation
